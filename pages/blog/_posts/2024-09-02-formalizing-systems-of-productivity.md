## personal system
### What do I struggle with, when it comes to productivity? 
- Time-management 
- doing things NOW
- staying away from distractors
- not prioritizing my own needs
- not being able to lock into a flow state 
- losing track of targets and projects
### How can I fix these issues? 
- Scheduling tasks ahead of time 
- Using productivity techniques to "hack" my brain
- Using content blockers and cognitive therapy-ish techniques 
- Sticking to the schedule I have set
- Getting a quiet workspace that I can focus in 
- maintaing a meta-consciousness about the effectiveness about my habits
### Going into specifics: 
- Using routine + daily notes to plan out what is going to happen each day and keep momentum moving. Can set up day with routine, and summarize what happened in a daily journal before winding-down and self-reflection.
- Combine SelfControl with physical distance to prevent hacks from happening. Putting my phone into one of those lockboxes would be useful. Or creating a habit of only checking my phone once a hour
- Using the 2-minute and 1-2-3 method to get started on this happening right now
- Using a timer to stay on focused for short amounts of time until i lock into the flow state for multiple hours
- Nothing I can do about a quiet workspace right now
### What else can I do?
- keep myself occupied with productive tasks that work towards a greater goal which I actually find engaging
- mentally work through why I am taking certain actions to combat negative habits and addictions
- Accepting that I just need to start doing something. It's okay if I waste some time during the beginning process (the 10:15->10:20->10:50 fallacy) as long as I get into the swing of it eventually. 

### Summary 
I already have a good idea of what I need to change. Some concrete next steps to take would be defining some recurring habits and timeboxes to provide structure to my week now that I am done with school and have a ton of free time. The main problem with my current system isn't that I can't get things done, but rather a lack of self-accountability that is keeping me from reaching my goals. Contextualizing this as not a problem with myself but rather a discrete conflict between the id & ego means that I can work towards consciously changing my actions to better myself. I think that this was a good exercise in thought.
