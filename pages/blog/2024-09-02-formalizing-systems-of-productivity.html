<h3>What do I struggle with, when it comes to productivity?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time-management </li>
<li>doing things NOW</li>
<li>staying away from distractors</li>
<li>not prioritizing my own needs</li>
<li>not being able to lock into a flow state </li>
<li>losing track of targets and projects</li>
</ul>
<h3>How can I fix these issues?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scheduling tasks ahead of time </li>
<li>Using productivity techniques to "hack" my brain</li>
<li>Using content blockers and cognitive therapy-ish techniques </li>
<li>Sticking to the schedule I have set</li>
<li>Getting a quiet workspace that I can focus in </li>
<li>maintaing a meta-consciousness about the effectiveness about my habits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Going into specifics:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using routine + daily notes to plan out what is going to happen each day and keep momentum moving. Can set up day with routine, and summarize what happened in a daily journal before winding-down and self-reflection.</li>
<li>Combine SelfControl with physical distance to prevent hacks from happening. Putting my phone into one of those lockboxes would be useful. Or creating a habit of only checking my phone once a hour</li>
<li>Using the 2-minute and 1-2-3 method to get started on this happening right now</li>
<li>Using a timer to stay on focused for short amounts of time until i lock into the flow state for multiple hours</li>
<li>Nothing I can do about a quiet workspace right now</li>
</ul>
<h3>What else can I do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>keep myself occupied with productive tasks that work towards a greater goal which I actually find engaging</li>
<li>mentally work through why I am taking certain actions to combat negative habits and addictions</li>
<li>Accepting that I just need to start doing something. It's okay if I waste some time during the beginning process (the 10:15-&gt;10:20-&gt;10:50 fallacy) as long as I get into the swing of it eventually. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I already have a good idea of what I need to change. Some concrete next steps to take would be defining some recurring habits and timeboxes to provide structure to my week now that I am done with school and have a ton of free time. The main problem with my current system isn't that I can't get things done, but rather a lack of self-accountability that is keeping me from reaching my goals. Contextualizing this as not a problem with myself but rather a discrete conflict between the id &amp; ego means that I can work towards consciously changing my actions to better myself. I think that this was a good exercise in thought.</p>
