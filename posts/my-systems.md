Hey everyone, with the New Year rapidly approaching, I thought it would be interesting to save a time capsule of my personal productivity system as it stands right now. It's certainly going to evolve through the coming year, and I hope to write an updated version of this note next year, with new and improved insights.

# Step 1: Input

The first step to getting things done is processing my daily inputs into manageable chunks of work.

I try to keep things simple.
I'm currently using Todoist for task creation and management, but I've been toying with Apple's Reminders.
Both are incredibly simple so I can focus on actually important work instead of devoting time to maintaing and refreshing overly complicated hand-crafted systems.
Notion, I'm looking at you.

I keep the following lists/projects in my task manager:

1. Administration: For basic tasks like paying bills or registering for classes.
2. Homework: For homework, duh.
3. Extracurriculars: For my clubs and research, and Atland.
4. Project: For my current passion project of choice.
5. For Later: For keeping an eye on milestones and opportunities on the horizon.

I also use Apple Notes to note down interesting stray ideas that I want to look into when I'm free. This can be an interesting tidbit of news, a new book, an idea for a blog post or portfolio projects, or anything in between.

# Step 2: Planning

Once I have everything written down, I allocate time on my calendar for each line item.

I use [Reclaim](https://reclaim.ai/) to automate the process. I've bounced around a lot of different apps that can do something similar, either manually or automatically, but I ended up on Reclaim for a combination of reasons. I won't go into detail right now, but if you revisit this article at a later date, you may find I've expanded this section to explain why I landed on Reclaim.
Additionally, Todoist supports integration with Reclaim which makes transferring tasks seamless.

I'm also a heavy user of Habits on Reclaim. For example, instead of syncing the tasks in my Administration list to Reclaim, I have a habit that blocks time every week to complete them all at once. In my experience, it only wastes time and brainpower to schedule and manage a lot of minute 15-30 minute tasks, so that habit has saved me a lot of time. I also use Habits when I'm learning autodidactically, so I don't have defined tasks to be completed. Instead I aim to set aside some time every week just for that.

However, Reclaim is definitely quite clunky at times. It doesn't have an app for on-the-go use (instead option for a progressive web app with distinctly mobile-unfriendly UI), mass-modifying anything becomes tedious extremely quickly, and it's quite slow to update its calendar. Because of this, I only actively edit my Reclaim calendar once every morning, instead of continuously adding new tasks throughout the day.
Every morning, I review Reclaim's plan for my day to make sure its reasonable and modify tasks & habits as necessary.

Once I'm done with that, I try not to touch it again until tomorrow. Instead, I use Google Calendar to keep track of my schedule and make adjustments on the fly. Because Reclaim creates all of its events on a synced Google Calendar and protects manually scheduled events, I can easily make simple changes as my plans start to fall apart (as they always do).

# Step 3: Doing

Of course, all thought put towards task management goes to complete waste if I don't actually sit down and get things done.

What's working for me right now is the Pomodoro method with one small tweak. I find that the commonly used 25-minute work timer is too short for me, so I've lengthened it to 40 minutes. In my eyes, this is the perfect duration to get immersed in my work, but not so long that I feel tired afterwards. However, I often find myself disregarding the timers altogether when working on large amounts of work or particularly engrossing subjects. I'm definitely not a Pomodoro purist, as I use Pomodor to overcome endless procrastination instead of the traditional goal of channeling focus. I'd say just find what works for you, instead of blindly following the lastest productivity guru's advice on the "best" methods.

Another tool I use to keep myself focused is my iPhone's Work Focus. Silencing some notifications already helps a ton, but assigning each focus mode a different home page takes it to the next level. On my home page for Work Focus, all I've got is an Apple Notes widget where I've written one **fun** thing I've planned for the evening. This helps me avoid distracting apps in two ways. First, they've been removed from easy access through notifications and the home screen. Second, I'm reminded that I need to get things done now to afford fun with my friends later. But I'm sure I'm still not using Focus Modes to their maximum potential, so I'm still exploring how I can better leverage them.

# Step 4: Then What?

I like getting a lot of things done, but it's a slippery slope. I've often fell into the trap of grinding too hard, feeling burnt out, and wasting multiple days or weeks doing basically nothing. Thus, I make it a priority to plan some time for fun each week on that Apple Note. I like doing this because the things I actively plan for tend to be much more fulfilling and just as enjoyable as distractions like Instagram that derail my work.

Oh, and I know you are **extremely** disappointed that there aren't any images right now, but I'll (hopefully) add some in the future.
