I'm writing this for two reasons. First, I hope I can give food for thought regarding productivity to anyone who reads this. Second, I'm currently going through a slump in getting things done, and I find that revamping my systems always helps me get back in the swing of things. _Note: It's also important to not let creating systems turn into work over your actual work, so to combat that, I've set a timer for myself when writing this article._

# Step 1: Input

The first step to getting things done is processing the vast amount of data we take in day-to-day into action items that can be portioned out into bite-sized pieces of work.

I try to keep things simple. I'm currently using Todoist, but I've been toggling between Apple's Reminders and Todoist for managing all my tasks. Both are set up incredibly simply, with just the bare minimum effort put into jotting things down.
I keep the following lists/projects in my task manager:

1. Administration - This is for basic tasks, like paying bills on time or filling out registration forms for classes.
2. Homework - For homework, duh.
3. Extracurriculars - I store everything related to clubs / research here.
4. Project - Just a blank space for when I'm intensively working on a project. Regularly rotates.
5. For Later - Things in here aren't going to be applicable anytime soon, but I want keep an eye on them.

I also use Apple Notes to note down stray ideas that I want to look into down the line.

# Step 2: Planning

Once I have everything that I need to be written down so I don't forget, I need to start planning my days so I can get everything done.

For this, I primarily use [Reclaim](https://reclaim.ai/). I've bounced around a lot of different apps, but I ended up on Reclaim for a few different reasons. I won't go into detail right now, but if you revisit this article at a later date, you may find I've expanded this section to explain why I landed on Reclaim.

Reclaim can be quite clunky at times, which is a definite drawback. It doesn't have an app for ease of use on the go, and it's pretty slow while updating. Because of this, using Reclaim is a discrete step of my morning worktime, instead of a continuous process.

Every morning, I review Reclaim's plan for my day to make sure its reasonable and modify tasks & habits as necessary. Todoist integrates with Reclaim which makes inputs super easy, so I usually spend my time assigning priorities and calendars to schedule on.

I'm also a heavy user of Habits on Reclaim. For example, instead of syncing the tasks in my Administration list onto Reclaim, I have a habit to block some time every week to complete them in one go. I find it's a waste of time to assign tasks that can be completed very quickly onto Reclaim. This also helps me when I'm learning something new, where I don't have defined tasks to be completed, and I'm instead aiming to set aside time just for learning.

Once I'm done putting everything into Reclaim, I try not to touch it again until the next day. Instead, I use Google Calendar to make sure I'm getting everything done that day and make adjustments to my schedule on the fly. Because Reclaim syncs all events to Google Calendar and protects manually scheduled events, it's very easy to shift things around.

# Step 3: DOING

Of course, all this complexity with task management goes to a complete waste if I don't actually sit down and get things done.

I'm an active user of the Pomodoro method, with one small tweak. I find that the commonly used 25-minute work timer is too short for me, so I've lengthened it to 40 minutes. This is the perfect length for me to enter a flow state, but not to the point where I start feeling tired. However, I still often find myself disregarding the timers when working on large amounts of work or engrossing subjects. For me, that's still okay because the structure of the timers helps me get started.

Another tool I use to keep myself focused is my iPhone's Work Focus. The trick of assigning each focus mode a different home page is working quite well for me. On my home page for Work Focus, I've got just the essential apps and a Apple Notes widget where I've written one **fun** thing I've planned for the evening. I also silence all notifications except those from my parents, calendar, and essential apps like banking. Right now, I certainly haven't extracted all the value I can from Focus Modes, so I'm still exploring how I can better leverage them.

# Step 4: Then What?

I mentioned before that I have a note of the fun things I'm planning to do. I like doing this because I find the things I can actually write down to be much more fulfilling and just as enjoyable as temporary distractions like Instagram that can derail my productivity plans for the day.

Therefore, I try to set aside the couple hours after 7 pm to when I go to sleep solely for leisure. I've also started using thiat as a very light form of journal, as I update the note with my feelings on those activities.

Oh, and I know that there aren't any images right now, but I'll (hopefully) add some in the future.
