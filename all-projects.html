          >Developed a classifier and regression model using RDKit, Random
          Forest, and XGBoost to predict molecular activity (ROC-AUC) and
          binding affinity (RMSE) from SMILES strings.</span

          multilingual biomedical literature for neurological gene-disease-drug
          associations, building a time-indexed knowledge graph with key metrics

        <span
          >Developed a drug optimization pipeline using Deep Q-Networks (DQN),
          where the agent modifies molecular structures represented as graphs
          using a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based environment; evaluated
          optimization success using QED (Quantitative Estimate of
          Drug-likeness), binding affinity scores from docking simulations
          (e.g., AutoDock), and toxicity predictions generated by pre-trained
          classification models.
